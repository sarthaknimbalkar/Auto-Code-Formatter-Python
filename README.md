# Automatic Python File Formatting and Correctness Evaluation Website

The Automatic Python File Formatting and Correctness Evaluation Website is a web-based application developed using Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to leverage advanced AI algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Simulated Annealing for automatic Python file formatting and evaluating correctness based on predefined coding standards.

## Key Features

- Automatic Python file formatting using DFS and Simulated Annealing algorithms
- File correctness evaluation based on defined coding standards
- Simple and intuitive user interface for seamless navigation
- Robust data management with SQLite for efficient file storage
- Strong security measures to protect user data and ensure confidentiality
- Thoroughly tested for reliability and performance optimization
- Deployment on cloud services for scalability and accessibility
